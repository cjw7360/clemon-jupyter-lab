```

## Unknown
* In default conda base env, `%matplotlib widget` is invaild, but a new env works fine for that.

## Build Tips
* In china, build should do under global proxy. (Don't know why Taobao(Or other) source of `yarn` do not work for `jupyter lab build` cmd)
* In version 2.x of jupyter lab, matplotlib„ÄÅipympl and jupyter-matplotlib must use special version. (Ver 3.x of jupyter lab has shiped with matplotlib, but this version has not official docker image)
* Conda source of Tsinghua University is also work instability. BFSU source work well.
